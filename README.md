# User-Interactive-Form
This Excel VBA project aims to enhance user interaction with Excel workbooks by providing a user-friendly interface through a custom UserForm. The main functionalities include:

**Adding Worksheets**: Users can add new worksheets with custom names while handling errors gracefully, ensuring that invalid names do not disrupt workflow.
**Dynamic Worksheet Selection**: A combo box allows users to easily select and navigate between existing worksheets, improving accessibility within the workbook.
**Report Generation**: A button is provided to run a specific report (LoopYearlyReport), streamlining reporting tasks.
Overall, this project serves to improve productivity and user experience in Excel through automation and intuitive design.
